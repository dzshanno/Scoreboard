# Scoreboard

*** update 4th Mar 2017 - prototype 1 well received - starting to think of next steps ***

-- A project to self build an electronic scoreboard for Wallingford Hockey Club --

A commercial scoreboard appears to be out of reach - lets build one!!

Requirements

Big enough to be seen from the other side of the pitch ~50-70m
Lasts 6hours at least without mains power
Score can be updated at a distance ~50-100m

Shows 2 scores - home team and away team
Max score 19 goals

Team names added as printed signs

Cost <Â£500

Be durable in the british weather

Ideally would also:

Have a timer to show time left
Indicator of 1st 2nd half or 1st 2nd 3rd 4th quarter

As a stretch goal could be interrogated remotely ( not from the pitch side) to ask the current score

see the wiki for more info and plans
